	abstract = {In this paper we describe the memory-based machine learning system that we submitted to the BioNLP Shared Task on Event Extraction. We modeled the event extraction task using an approach that has been previously applied to other natural language processing tasks like semantic role labeling or negation scope ﬁnding. The results obtained by our system (30.58 F-score in Task 1 and 29.27 in Task 2) suggest that the approach and the system need further adaptation to the complexity involved in extracting biomedical events.},

	abstract = {Event detection (ED), a sub-task of event extraction, involves identifying triggers and categorizing event mentions. Existing methods primarily rely upon supervised learning and require large-scale labeled event datasets which are unfortunately not readily available in many real-life applications. In this paper, we consider and reformulate the ED task with limited labeled data as a Few-Shot Learning problem. We propose a Dynamic-Memory-Based Prototypical Network (DMB-PN), which exploits Dynamic Memory Network (DMN) to not only learn better prototypes for event types, but also produce more robust sentence encodings for event mentions. Differing from vanilla prototypical networks simply computing event prototypes by averaging, which only consume event mentions once, our model is more robust and is capable of distilling contextual information from event mentions for multiple times due to the multi-hop mechanism of DMNs. The experiments show that DMB-PN not only deals with sample scarcity better than a series of baseline models but also performs more robustly when the variety of event types is relatively large and the instance quantity is extremely small.},
